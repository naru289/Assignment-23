There you annotate some ground truth region in your image and then make an automated algorithm to do it. You validate the algorithm by calculating the Dice score, which is a measure of how similar the objects are. So it is the size of the overlap of the two segmentations divided by the total size of the two objects. Using the same terms as describing accuracy, the Dice score is:\n",

        "\n",
        "For a measure of accuracy we will be using Dice Score also know as F1 Score because if we use normal pixel accuracy since 80% of the mask image is black, the model can get an accuracy of 80% just by generating a black screen every time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Dice score is not only a measure of how many positives you find, but it also penalizes for the false positives that the method finds, similar to precision. so it is more similar to precision than accuracy.

So the Dice score is also penalizing for the positives that your algorithm/method could not find.\n",
